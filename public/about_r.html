<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Rodica Predescu and I am from Romania. I worked as an engineer for more than twenty-seven years, 
  but I left because the company closed. Then, for about six years, I worked as a psychologist in a private practice.

<p>
  At the moment, I am intensively learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, because I want to work as a Web Developer as soon as possible. 
  <br /><br />
  I really like this course and I am learning with great pleasure and passion!
